title:  "Project Contributions"
---

My primary contribution to Spatium is the addition of a unique feature set
revolving around management of planetary ecology. This feature connects to
Spatium's theme (colonisation of new worlds due to Earth's climate crisis)
and sets it apart from other games with similar characteristics.

### Ideation

My first task was to design the concept for a unique game feature and then plan
the game design features and impacts for that concept.

To generate ideas, I used two ideation techniques: brainstorming, and something
called "Crazy Eights" where visual representations of ideas are rapidly
sketched to promote lateral thinking. 

![brainstorm](assets/images/brainstorm.jpg)  
*Fig 4. `brainstorm.jpg`: brainstorming whiteboard output*

Conceptual categories (from centre, then clockwise):

* the overarching idea
* natural planetary environmental features that may be impacted
* harms
* techniques to protect and rehabilitate environmental features
* buildings used to prevent and repair harm

![crazy eights](assets/images/crazy_eights_1.jpg)  
*Fig 5. `crazy_eights_1.jpg`: crazy eights paper output 1-4*

Ideas (from top left, then clockwise):

* Active resource extraction causes waste products, which harm the ground
and/or must be removed
* Some partially automated extraction building must have a waste disposal
strategy, early building might just dump it in a river and cause river
pollution
* Early game power generation might be replaced by future generation sources
that are cleaner energy
* The player might have an in game UI to see planetary environmental/ecological
health metrics

*Fig 6. `crazy_eights_2.jpg`: crazy eights paper output 5-8*

Ideas (from top left, then clockwise):

* A player might be able to visit sites of damage and repair them for some
cost, this might have multiple phases
* Crops might have a yield that relates to land quality, influenced by
environmental/land management
* Combat might cause environmental damage (particularly with more powerful
weapons, or with some types of combat/enemies)
* Upgrading resource extraction (or specific protection buildings like a water
filtration system) might reduce environmental harm, protect against future harm
or improve current metrics

**Outcomes**

An original idea was identified as required in the trimester 2 handover to
differentiate Spatium from other open world sci-fi games. I came up with a
thematically relevant, highly marketable idea with multiple pathways to
implementation into concrete game mechanics.

In doing so, I provided the team with a contribution that will satisfy the
requirement to include a unique feature as a key selling point for our game.

### Game Design

I consolidated generated ideas into a vision for the mechanic, focused on three
areas: measurement of planetary ecology, game mechanics influencing ecology and
the impact of ecology on the player.

![vision](assets/images/vision.png)  
*Fig 7. `vision.png`: vision documentation from confluence*

Ecology management is a topical theme with two purposes. It is intended to
invite the player to consider their role and impact on the Earth's climate, but
must also operate through gameplay mechanics that are well defined and
enjoyable. The initial implementation was also designed with pragmatism in mind
to ensure that a challenging but achievable amount of work was committed to for
this trimester.

![initial_implementation](assets/images/initial_implementation.png)  
*Fig 8. `initial_implementation.png`: initial implementation documentation from
confluence*

**Outcomes**

Effectively designed game features are essential to a coherent player
experience. Spatium's development has previously lacked concrete planning for
features including implementation specifics and impact on other areas of the
game.

This game design work ensured that fully thought out mechanics were designed
with a clear implementation plan for this trimester and details for students
in future trimesters to continue on with.

### Identification of Art Assets

After planning the implementation of the ecology preservation mechanic for this
trimester, I was able to define what art assets were required so that I could
provide this definition to a junior team member to produce the assets and
incorporate them into the game.

Three assets were identified and defined:

![art_assets](assets/images/art_assets.png)  
*Fig 9. `art_assets.png`: summary of three art assets required*

Mining resoures was to produce visible damage to the soil where the resource
had been. This could be realistic and familiar to mining damaged soil on Earth,
or some licence could be taken to create a more alien interpretation.

A power unit building was designed that would provide early power requirements
for base building, but that would damage the atmosphere when built. There are
many inspirations available from power generation on Earth today.

Finally a user interface would need to be designed that provides the player
with a clear and understandable summary of the current planets ecology state.

The assets were defined and discussed with a junior student on Microsoft Teams
on the 15th and 16th of December and then on the 4th of January. Chat logs are
available if required.

**Outcomes**

Identification, specification and communication of art assets required for the
ecology mechanic was required so that the work associated with the feature
could be split into discrete chunks and worked on independently.

I completed this task so that the team could continue to work effectively in
parallel, which ensured our team was productive.

### Blueprints (Coding) Planning

The next step that I took was to plan the changes and additions required to the
game code to implement the ecology mechanics.

Spatium uses the Unreal Engine Blueprints system, which is a visual coding
environment.

I explored the existing code associated with the project and developed a
dependency graph to understand what existing structures would be impacted by my
changes. I further detailed those changes specifically, and the new additions
that would be required.

*Fig 10. `blueprint_relationships.png`: dependency graph*

![measurement_code_plans](assets/images/measurement_code_plans.png)  
*Fig 11. `measurement_code_plans.png`: planned changes and additions to the
measurement system*

![base_building_code_plans](assets/images/base_building_code_plans.png)  
*Fig 13. `base_building_code_plans.png`: planned changes and additions to the
base building system*

**Outcomes**

My experience as a software developer has taught me that applications and
features are generally easier to program, have fewer bugs and require less
rework when they are planned up front. Carefully thinking through and designing
an implementation plan before jumping into code is considered best practice
software engineering. The benefits of this approach are realised below, when
only one minor bug was found during QA of all the implemented features
associated with the ecology mechanic.

### Blueprints (Coding) Implementation

Following planning, came implementation. I edited and created the relevant
blueprints in our Unreal Engine project to implement the ecology preservation
mechanics.

There are a large number of changes, so a sample is presented here.

**Power unit blueprints sample:**

![ecology_ui_widget_functions](assets/images/ecology_ui_widget_functions.png)  
*Fig 25. `ecology_ui_widget_functions.png`: UI widget functions*

**Resource extraction blueprints sample:**

*Fig 26. `soil_damage_actor_viewport.png`: new Soil Damage Actor viewport*

![soil_damage_constructor](assets/images/soil_damage_constructor.png)

![existing_mining_flow_change](assets/images/existing_mining_flow_change.png)  
*Fig 28. `existing_mining_flow_change.png`: changes to existing mining flow*

**Outcomes**

My code was thoroughly tested by the squad leader (and myself). Only one minor
bug was found to do with building location and type which was easily addressed.

Consider the significant number of changes and additions, the bug-free outcome
speaks to a high quality contribution. This is especially true considering that
my contributions were made to an existing codebase with significant
interdependencies and some accumulated technical debt.

### Backfilling Task - Art Asset Implementation

Due to other commitments exceeding time estimates, the junior student wasn't
able to complete design and implementation of the provided art assets for the
ecology preservation mechanic. In order to ensure the feature made it into the
game, I backfilled the junior student on this task.

I designed and implemented the ecology user interface panel and soil damage
visual asset. I selected and modified the existing command base asset for the
power unit.

![ecology_ui](assets/images/ecology_ui.png)  
*Fig 29. `ecology_ui.png`: ecology user interface (in-game)*

![soil_damage](assets/images/soil_damage.png)  
*Fig 30. `soil_damage.png`: soil damage after mining (in-game)*

![power_unit](assets/images/power_unit.png)  
*Fig 31. `power_unit.png`: power unit building (in-game)*

**Outcomes**

Though this task was completed in limited time, the UI was described by team
members as clear, and the soil damage and power unit as being pretty good. I
am confident that they do more than serve the role of demonstrating the ecology
feature as placeholders and believe that the UI and visual assets might be
tweaked but will remain in the game until the beta release.

### Additional Contributions

In addition to developing this feature, I contributed to quality assurance and
testing. I had 3 assigned tasks relating to QA:

* Testing Mission 1 and the 3 associated Quests
* Testing the Quest User Interface
* Testing the Alien Artificial Intelligence

TODO: testing process and outcomes (reported 2 issues, both resolved)

### Implemented Feature Demonstration

This short video demonstrates some of the ecology mechanic features in game.

In the video, one of the characters mines a resource. As this finishes, the
soil damage appears on the ground, the Soil Health and Biosphere Health of
Domum go down, as is visible in the ecology UI.

The character then builds a command base. When he does so, the power used
changes from 0 of 10 to 8 of 10 (also visible in the UI). The character then
builds a power unit, increasing the power cap so that power usage is now 8 of
a cap of 22. This also reduces the Atmosphere Health and Biosphere Health of
Domum.

**Outcomes**

My contribution to the project was meaningful and helped the team meet the
project requirements. My final submission to justify this assertion is this
quote supplied by the squad leader (with permission):

> Philip joined the squad as a senior student at the start of trimester 3, 2019
> and proved to be a highly valuable member of the squad. He integrated quickly
> into an unfamiliar project and adapted to the demands of his role as a senior
> student with aplomb. He was tasked with assisting to create a project roadmap
> and define the trimester work tasks. He also designed and implemented a new
> ecology preservation mechanic that was added to the game this trimester. He
> completed all assigned work tasks and made many significant contributions to
> group assessment tasks. He was punctual and attended required meetings and
> provided insightful and practical input. In short Philip was a fantastic
> collaborator and I feel very fortunate to have worked on this project with
> him.
