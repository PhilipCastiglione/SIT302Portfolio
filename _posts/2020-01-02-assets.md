Spatium is a genre-spanning open world epic with a sci fi theme. Primarily an
open world sandbox, Spatium has gameplay elements of 3rd person shooters,
spaceship combat, survival and simulation games.

Project asset links can also be found on the

### Project Management

Atlassian SaaS products were used to manage Spatium. Documentation was kept on
Confluence and Jira was used for project and task management. The code resides
in a
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket-students.deakin.edu.au/projects/IG-SPATIUM/repos/spatium-t319/)
repository.

Confluence and Jira are run on privately hosted instances that are not publicly
sharable, so screenshots are provided below of contributions to documentation
on confluence, and the Jira tickets assigned and completed.

Deakin IT can grant access to the BitBucket repository.

### Game Assets

Spatium is developed using Unreal Engine. An executable game bundle is hosted
TODO: where? how to use it?

A gameplay video demonstration is available [here](assets/videos/IGS2_Spatium_Demo_Video.mp4).
