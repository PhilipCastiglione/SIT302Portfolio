### Project Management

Atlassian SaaS products were used to manage Spatium. Documentation is on
[Confluence](https://sit374confluence.prancingturtle.com:8443),
[Jira](https://sit374jira.prancingturtle.com:8443) was used for project and
task management and the code resides in a
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket-students.deakin.edu.au/projects/IG-SPATIUM/repos/spatium-t319/)
repository.

Confluence and Jira are run on privately hosted instances that will require an
account to access TODO: how?

Deakin IT can grant access to the BitBucket repository.

### Game Assets

Spatium is developed using Unreal Engine. An executable game bundle is hosted
TODO: where? how to use it?
